Code challenge (30 mins)
The attached CSV file contains a table with 3 columns, containing date, rainfall and temperature data for a site over the period of a single calendar month, July 2017.

The format of the data is as follows:
* date - ISO 8601 format, eg '2017-11-01'
* rainfall - expressed in mm
* temperature - expressed in degrees C

Your task is write a short program in any language you choose to parse this data and produce a summary report, with the following information:
* number of rainy days in the month
* Average temperature for month


A rainy day is defined as a day on which >= 2mm of rain was recorded.

Optional:
* Average temperature on rainy days in the month
* Average temperature on non rainy days in the month

 For merit, the following should be noted about the CSV input data, and handled in your program:
* Explain what you are trying to do in comments on the code
* Some records exist outside the calendar month of July 2017, and should be excluded
* Some days no data may be recorded, so the percentage and average total should reflect this
* Some duplicate records may exist in the data, and should be excluded

Optional Creative Challenge (10 minutes)

Create a ‘mockup’ of the summary report (pdf, jpeg, etc) to present the information above in any way you please.
